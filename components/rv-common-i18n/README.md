Rise Vision Common i18n
==============

**Copyright Â© 2014 - Rise Vision Incorporated.**

## Introduction
Common i18n files to be shared across Rise Vision apps, widgets and components.

## Built With

- *NPM*
- *Gulp*
- *Bower*


## Development

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation

1. Install node dependencies `$ npm install`

2. Install front-end dependencies `$ bower install`

## Development Notes
All translation files go under `/src/locales/{lang}`, where {lang} should be replaced with the language code the translation file applies to. The file extension must be .po. PO is the main format and the one used as source for the generated production files.

Alternatively, you can modify the JSON files located in `/src/locales_json/{lang}` and convert them to PO using `$ gulp json-to-po`. These files are provided as a convenience, and it's important to note that they are overwritten everytime `$ gulp build` is ran.


### Run Local
Run `$ gulp` to see a list of available tasks.


## Build
To build run `$ gulp build`. This will generate a `dist` folder with a `locales` folder, containing a combined and minified json file for each locale, named translation_{lang}.json.

The JSON files in `locales_json` will also be regenerated based on the existing PO files.


## Usage
Install the common-i18n using bower `$ bower install git://github.com/Rise-Vision/common-i18n --save`

The `dist` folder contains the minified version of the `src/locales` folder.

An i18n.js file is provided, which contains an Angularjs module with the necessary dependencies on angular-translate and the static-files plugin. This module can be plugged-in as a dependency on the Angularjs application or component that needs translation of messages.

### Using the provided i18n module

In case you are using the provided i18n Angularjs module, you will need to include the following script reference in your main HTML page:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="components/rv-common-i18n/dist/i18n.js"></script>
```

The next step is configuring the prefix and sufix paths for the translation files. Using environment specific config files is recommended. A local development environment would use:

    angular.module("risevision.common.i18n.config", [])  
      .constant("LOCALES_PREFIX", "components/rv-common-i18n/dist/locales/translation_")  
      .constant("LOCALES_SUFIX", ".json");  

While a production/staging environment would use:

    angular.module("risevision.common.i18n.config", [])  
      .constant("LOCALES_PREFIX", "locales/translation_")  
      .constant("LOCALES_SUFIX", ".json");

For environments other than local, it is necessary to copy the translation files to the proper location. An example using Gulp (usually a "build" task will depend on the "locales" task):

    var localeFiles = [ "web/components/rv-common-i18n/dist/locales/**/*" ];  
    
    gulp.task("locales", ["clean"], function() {  
      return gulp.src(localeFiles)  
        .pipe(gulp.dest("dist/locales"));  
    });

Your Angularjs module will need to have a reference to *risevision.common.i18n*:

    angular.module("my-module", ["risevision.common.i18n"]);

### Dependencies
- Angularjs
- Angular translate
- Angular translate loader static files
