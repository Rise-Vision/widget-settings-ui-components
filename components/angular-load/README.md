Installation
------------

You can choose your preferred method of installation:
* Through bower: `bower install angular-load --save`
* Through npm: `npm install angular-load --save`
* Download from github: [angular-load.min.js](https://raw.github.com/urish/angular-load/master/angular-load.min.js)

Usage
-----
Include angular-load.js in your application.

```html
<script src="bower_components/angular-load/angular-load.js"></script>
```

Add the module `angularLoad` as a dependency to your app module:

```js
var myapp = angular.module('myapp', ['angularLoad']);
```

### angularLoad service directive
The angularLoad service provides two methods: `loadScript()` and `loadCSS()`. Call these methods to load a script
or a CSS stylesheet asynchronously into the current page. Both methods return a promise that will be resolved
once the resource (script or stylesheet) has been loaded. In case of an error (e.g. HTTP 404) the promise will be
rejected.

Usage example:

```js
angularLoad.loadScript('https://mysite.com/someplugin.js').then(function() {
	// Script loaded succesfully.
	// We can now start using the functions from someplugin.js
}).catch(function() {
    // There was some error loading the script. Meh
});
```
