Rise Vision Common Style
==============

**Copyright Â© 2014 - Rise Vision Incorporated.**

*Use of this software is governed by the GPLv3 license (available in the LICENSE file).*

## Introduction
Common CSS styling to be shared across Rise Vision apps, widgets and components. The style guide is published as github pages is available as reference documentation for all Rise Vision UI-components:
**http://rise-vision.github.io/style-guide**

## Built With

- *NPM*
- *Angularjs*
- *Gulp*
- *Bower*
- *Bootstrap (SASS)*


## Development

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation

1. Install node dependencies `$ npm install`

2. Install front-end dependencies `$ bower install`


## Development Notes
All SASS files go under `/src`. To include them in the final CSS file add them as `imports` in the `app.scss` file.

The build process will pull in all the custom SASS files and the bootstrap SASS files and generate a single `rise.min.css` file. The hierarchy and overwrites are controlled within the `rise.min.css` file. The naming/directory structure has no impact on this.

### Run Local
Run `$ gulp` to see a list of available tasks and `$ gulp dev` to watch for and compile SASS.


## Build
To build run `$gulp build`. This will generate a `dist` folder with `css` and `font` folders.


## Usage
Install the common-style using bower `$ bower install git://github.com/Rise-Vision/common-style --save`

The `dist` folder contains the compiled CSS `css/rise.min.css` and all required fonts.

### Dependencies
- Bootstrap-sass-official
- Select2
- Spectrum
- Font-awesome
